How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? Testing code thoroughly helps to ensure code is functional and secure. It validates inputs and makes sure exceptions are handled, and also checks to see that the functionality of the program matches the users requirements.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? The way I interpreted user needs was to just follow their exact specifications they had given, and turn those into use cases. From there I used the use cases to develop Junit tests and tested the code against the users requirements.

How do I approach designing software? The most important step in designing software for me was to discover what the use cases should be. If you don't know what the customer wants done, you can't design the software correctly. After that I code my software with the use cases in mind, and test it thoroughly using the reqirements set by the customer.
